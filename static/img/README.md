# Photos of Members of Congress

These were provided by the Sunlight Foundation on their [Sunlight Congress API page](http://services.sunlightlabs.com/docs/Sunlight_Congress_API/). 

There are 3 folders, organized by the size of the images. The photos are named according to their bioguide ID.

The directories should be:

    40x50/
    100x125/
    200x250/

I am not including them in the Git repository (for now). TODO: add a note about this to the main install/setup README.
